Shovel-server
=============
Access your shovel tasks through an API.

This has been moved out of the main `shovel` repo and into its own for clarity
and better encapsulation. As such, this repo is currently pretty scant, but can
grow with interest. It's also unclear what its compatibility with the latest
version of shovel is.
